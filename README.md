#Stock App

## Description 
  Created this application because I wanted an easier way to see look up stocks and have it evaluate wether or not it has had an upward trend recently. 
  I used a MEAN stack which consist of Mongodb, ExpressJs, Angularjs and, NodeJs. The reason that I used this type of stack was to experiment with a different
  approach to software devlopment. 
  The typeahead feature of this app is my favorite part because it guesses the stock symbol based what you are typing and comes in handy if you don't know the stock symbol for a company or vice versa. 
  It even uses the company name or stock symbol to decide what to show. The stock symbols are established by a connection to a Mongodb collection hosted on MongoLabs.
  One thing I would like to add to this project is to be able to update the Mongo Collection everytime a new stock symbol is created.
